<!-- Of course, you could just write {count * 2} in the markup instead â€” you don't have to use reactive values. Reactive values become particularly valuable (no pun intended) when you need to reference them multiple times, or you have values that depend on other reactive values. -->
<p>{count} doubled is {count*2}</p>

<!-- Note that reactive declarations and statements will run after other script code and before component markup is rendered. -->
